If you have found this, congratulations, you have reached Enlightenment.
It must have been a dark process. I bet the thought of ending it all was never far off your mind...
		
But alas, you have been freed. You now realize that birds can fly in space. 
Others think that with the absence of air resitence, how can the birds propel themselves?
		
You now must realize that there is another force in our galaxy that allows these creatures to fly. I call it the Space Force...
		
Welcome brother (or sister), and I'll see you at the end of the line.
